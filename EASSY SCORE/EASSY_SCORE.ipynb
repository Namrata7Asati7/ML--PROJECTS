      "['Between 1995 and 2010, a study was conducted representing the percentages of people born in Australia, versus people born outside Australia, living in urban, rural, and town. First, in 1995, cities represented the major percentage of habitat by roughly 50 percent, followed by rural areas and towns came in last, among people born in Australia. On the other hand, people born outside Australia, cities showed the most percentages of 6o percent, followed by rural areas and towns. In 2010, among people born in Australia, cities had an increase more than 20 percent increase in the total representation and a major decrease in towns and rural areas. Conversely, people born outside Australia, cities had the most percentage among both studies, followed by rural areas and towns.'\n",
      " \"Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.\"\n",
      " 'The left chart shows the population change happened in Austrilia from 1995 to 2010. In 1995, half of the people born in australia are from cities, 30% from rural areas and only 20% are from towns. For the people outside of Australia, most of the people still born in cities, which is around 60%. but the number of rural areas increased to 40% with the towns born rate decreased to only 10%.\\nIn 2010, The people born in cities increased significianly in both in and outside Australia, especially in outside Australia, which reached 80%.

      " 'Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.'\n",
      " 'The modern medicine is very important for living a long life. It on new technology. . Also modern medicine is human body. .

That is very important in the human society because their creative things are coming with them and they can help others for a longer time when they are living ., old population is increasing in the country.

In the modern medicine human kindness. People who have money can take modern medicine. But indigenous medicine has well human friendly shape.
